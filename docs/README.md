# TDEase docs

How humans and AI read `docs/`. The development rules, architecture mental
model and command cheat-sheet are all in
[`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md).

## What this product is

TDEase is an AI-first scientific analysis workspace for mass-spectrometry and proteomics
researchers who want to run and interpret analyses without becoming workflow engineers.
A user describes an analysis goal; the Agent selects a template and managed capabilities,
configures and validates the native workflow, submits a Run, supervises execution and
helps inspect the results.

It is calm, precise and forgiving — a dependable scientific workbench, quiet during
routine work and explicit when decisions or failures require attention. It **refuses to
be**: a node-editor that requires visual workflow construction; a parameter-wizard maze
exposing engine config before user intent; a card-grid dashboard competing with the real
results; opaque AI that hides its template, dry-run or execution facts; or anything that
forces advanced users to abandon it to reach ordinary files and scripts.

The primary path is intent → Agent → verified Run → inspectable result. The Run is the
primary operational object. Workspace files stay user-owned and native.

## Authority order

1. `../AGENTS.md` — development rules (binding).
2. `spec/` — accepted contracts (binding; one authority per fact).
3. `design/` — accepted designs; may be partially built.
4. `STATUS.md` — what is actually implemented today.
5. Code and tests — implementation evidence; they reveal status but do not silently
   replace an accepted contract.

When code contradicts a tier 2-4 document, one of them is wrong: either the document is
`stale` (fix it) or the code has a defect. Record which in `STATUS.md`. Never leave it
unresolved.

## Contract document format

A `spec/` document records a decision, and a decision is only readable together with what
it defeated. Every new contract, and every substantive revision of an existing one, must
carry an `## Alternatives considered` section: each real alternative that lost, and the one
line on why it lost. A contract without this section invites re-litigating a settled
decision — the section is the antidote, for humans and for AI maintainers alike.

Alternatives are recorded, not invented. When the history of a pre-existing contract
cannot be honestly reconstructed, say exactly that in the section and let the next
substantive revision fill it in; never fabricate a plausible loser. `design/` documents
follow the same rule when they record a rejected alternative.

## Quick entry points

Don't read everything. Start by task:

| You want to… | Read |
|---|---|
| Know what is built today | `STATUS.md` |
| Know where files live / who owns them | `spec/FILE-LAYOUT.md` |
| Understand the three-repo boundary | `design/THREE-REPOSITORY-ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| Call the Backend / understand a Run | `spec/WORKFLOW-RUN.md` |
| Build or use an Agent tool | `spec/AGENT-CONTRACT.md` |
| Understand the event/projection model | `design/CORE-ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| Check a Backend error code / envelope | `spec/FAILURE-CONTRACT.md` |
| Run or extend the test suite | `../AGENTS.md` (Commands) + `STATUS.md` (baseline) |
| Set up or operate a headless Windows VM for development, testing or release | `WINDOWS-HEADLESS.md` |
| Check whether a scientific path was already explored | git history + `archive/docs-cleanup-2026-09-29/` + `archive/docs-prune-2026-10-12/` |
| Check a past operational fix | `solutions/` |

Status is read from exactly one place: `STATUS.md`. Never infer status from
a document's presence, title or frontmatter — `design/` documents may be
partially built by design; their implemented state is whatever `STATUS.md`
says it is.

## Not authoritative

These live under `docs/` but are **not** product authority:

- `paper/` — research artifacts and manuscript drafts; never an Agent capability or prompt source.
  `paper/ref-paper/` — plain-text extracts of the reference literature (PDFs from the
  author's desktop), one `.md` per paper; reference material only.
- `solutions/` — operational playbooks; they cite owning contracts, never redefine them.
  `solutions/ai-harness/` documents the generic real-LLM CLI harness over the same
  `createAgentRuntime` as the product. It accepts the caller's raw prompt and has no
  task ids, preset scientific answers, replay scorer or ground-truth corpus.
- `RELEASE-VM.md` — operational note (Windows release VM guide).
- `design/ENGINE-*.html` — self-contained engine mechanism diagrams
  (submission→execution path, data/truth layers, worker process loop, node
  lifecycle), each carrying its own known-weakness card; rendered from the
  shipped code, reference material only.
- Process records archived 2026-09-29 to `archive/docs-cleanup-2026-09-29/`:
  `EXPLORATION-LOG.md`, `HARNESS-ENGINEERING-PLAN.md`, `PI-PARITY-PLAN.md`,
  `plans/pi-desktop-parity.md`, `NODES.md` (node-package inventory; provenance
  now lives in Run records). None were product authority; git history retains
  their tracked revisions.

## Status vs process records

The system has exactly two kinds of time. Keeping them apart is what keeps
lookup cheap — and it is the reason `STATUS.md` stays short:

- **Status** — `STATUS.md`. Answers only "what is true today". It is a
  snapshot: **rewrite it, never append**. Every line must be verifiable
  against the code and tests right now. Process narration ("today we
  removed X", pass-by-pass histories, commit hashes as narrative) does not
  belong here; a status file that has grown them is stale and gets
  rewritten, not edited further.
- **Logs / process records** — append-only; they answer "what happened,
  when, and what was decided". Each has one declared purpose and is never a
  source of current truth:
  - **git history** — the development record. Every narrative dropped from
    a STATUS rewrite remains retrievable here; that is what makes
    rewriting safe.
  - **`archive/docs-cleanup-2026-09-29/docs/EXPLORATION-LOG.md`** — the archived
    scientific loop memory (hypothesis → run → verdict); retired 2026-09-29,
    new rounds record verdicts in git history and case RECORD files.
  - **`paper/RECORD-*.md`** — adjudicated agent-session records for the
    paper cases.
  - **`HANDOFF-*.md`** — session-boundary handoffs (what is in flight,
    next steps, key paths); superseded once the work lands.

- **Migration rule**: when a log yields a conclusion that must be
  enforced, move it into the authority that owns it — a `spec/` contract,
  a `design/` document, or `STATUS.md` — never leave it only in the log.
  Conversely, a status statement cites the test that proves it today, not
  the story of when the work was done.

## Status vocabulary

- `implemented` — exercised through the intended interface, covered by a passing test.
- `partial` — a path exists but a named contract or verification is missing.
- `missing` — no implementation satisfies the contract.
- `deferred` — intentionally outside this release.
- `stale` — no longer describes the repository; fix or remove immediately.

Never infer status from a filename. Verify the active caller, the runtime path and the
relevant test. `implemented` requires a test that currently passes.
