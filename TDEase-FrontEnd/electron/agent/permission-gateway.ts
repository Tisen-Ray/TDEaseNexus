/**
 * Node-side PermissionGateway: the unbypassable permission + containment layer.
 *
 * Every tool call (builtin read/write, TDEase studio command, or MCP
 * dispatch, bash) funnels through one `decide(action)` here before it touches
 * the world. The decisions are NOT recomputed per call — they were resolved
 * once at bind time (deny > ask > allow across system/user/workspace rules, in
 * src/services/agent/permissionResolver) and frozen into
 * `SessionBinding.permissionCeiling`. A Pi `context` hook can narrow the active
 * tool set mid-run, but it can never widen this ceiling: that is the security
 * boundary (AGENT-CONTRACT.md §1).
 *
 * Containment is the other half. `resolveWorkspacePath` and `assertCommandCwd`
 * route every filesystem access and every bash cwd through `containedPath`,
 * which rejects `../` escapes and symlink breaks out of the Workspace root. This
 * is the same primitive the workspace layer uses, so a tool and a direct
 * workspace edit cannot disagree about what "inside the workspace" means.
 *
 * Why freeze at construction rather than re-resolve per call? Two reasons:
 *   1. Determinism — a replay must see the exact decisions the original run saw,
 *      not whatever the rules file says at replay time.
 *   2. Security — if a hostile process rewrote `.tdease/permissions.json` mid-
 *      turn to add `shell.exec: allow`, re-resolving per call would honor it.
 *      Freezing at bind time means the answer for the whole binding was settled
 *      before any tool ran.
