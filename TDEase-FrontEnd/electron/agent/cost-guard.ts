/**
 * The cost guard — TDEase's cost-constrained take on oh-my-pi's
 * time-traveling stream rules. A rule stays dormant until a tool call trips
 * it; the trip aborts the call at the last moment before cost is paid (the
 * tool never executes) and hands the model the rule as guidance, so its retry
 * inside the SAME turn takes the cheap path. The tripped rule is then
 * promoted to a session-scoped list the TDEaseExtension re-announces at each
 * loop's opening request — the `[plan]` mechanism — which is what makes the
 * rule survive compaction: it is re-pinned from state every loop, not carried
 * as transcript ballast.
 *
 * Two cost shapes are guarded (both native to this domain, where a single
 * acquisition file can weigh gigabytes):
 *
 *   1. WHOLE-FILE READS of oversized files. A read of a multi-GB mzML floods
 *      the context once and then keeps costing: the model pages through it in
 *      bounded slices, each slice a full provider request.
 *   2. SLICE PAGING. Even under the read cap, looping 400-line slices through
 *      a large file is a turn mill. After N slices of one file in a turn the
 *      guard stops the loop and demands a decision from what is already read.
 *
 * Everything else expensive is already bounded elsewhere (bash output, grep
 * matches, ls/find caps — tool-gateway constants), so the guard stays small
 * on purpose: it owns the two shapes nothing else measured.
