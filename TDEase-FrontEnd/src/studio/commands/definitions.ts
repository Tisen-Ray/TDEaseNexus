/**
 * The Studio command surface, assembled.
 *
 * Each family in `families/` is one capability seam: it binds a port (the
 * Service Definition, declared in `registry.ts` or the port module that
 * augments `CommandContext`) to the model-visible command contract, and holds
 * every family-local schema and input builder. Families never import each
 * other or this manifest — composition happens here, and here only, in
 * registration order: adding a command family means adding one module plus
 * one line below, touching nothing else (the seam rule this layout follows is
 * the capability-seam pattern: contract, provider, and consumer evolve
 * independently because they never share a module boundary).
 *
 * The order below is the registry's registration order. It is part of the
 * observable surface (agent tool listing, palette grouping) — insert new
 * families deliberately, do not sort.
