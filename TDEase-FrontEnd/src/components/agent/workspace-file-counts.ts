/**
 * Counts raw spectra and fasta reference files in the Workspace file tree,
 * for the empty state's goal selection (which offerings the data supports)
 * Best-effort: only counts nodes already scanned —
 * the root `fileTree` plus whatever the lazy-loading `directoryCache` has
 * listed (subdirectories the Navigator has not expanded yet are not walked).
 * Deriving this from what has already been scanned costs nothing extra;
 * walking the whole Workspace on every dock mount would not be free.
 *
 * Paths are deduped across the two sources: a directory's children can be
 * present both in the seed tree and in its cache listing, and a file must
 * never count twice.
