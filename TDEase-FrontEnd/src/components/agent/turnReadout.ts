/**
 * turnReadout — the provide/inject contract between AgentPage and the
 * AgentSettingsTab drawer.
 *
 * `useAgentTurn` owns the live turn state (context-window size, tokens used,
 * the bound model's image capability), but that state lives in a composable
 * instance, not a store. The settings drawer needs to read it without
 * AgentPage threading individual props through the tab registry (which takes
 * no props). So AgentPage provides this read-only projection, and the drawer
 * injects it.
 *
 * The values are the SAME refs the Composer used to bind directly — moved, not
 * duplicated. `null`-able so a tab rendered outside the provide scope (tests)
 * falls back gracefully instead of throwing.
